Using MySQL and Inquirer npm packages I have created an Amazon-like storefront. You are given 10 things in the inventory and have to order whichever one. However there is a limited stock and if you order more than is available you will get a message notifying you that there is no more of that product available!

Just keep answering the prompts and see the magic!
